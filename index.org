# so busy yearning for the moon that he never saw the sixpence at his feet

If you look on the ground in search of a sixpence, you don't look up, and so miss the moon.

I'm currently a PhD student in [[https://www.cs.iastate.edu/][CS@ISU]]
starting 2014 Fall.  I graduated from Electrical Engineering (1010) of
[[http://en.ustc.edu.cn/][USTC]] in 2014. See details in my
[[file:cv.pdf][CV(pdf)]].

* Projects

** Dynamic Analysis on Demand
I was researching in Program Language and Analysis from 2015 Summer to
2018 Spring. We designed an on-demand dynamic analysis framework,
called [[https://helium.lihebi.com][Helium]], and is
[[https://github.com/lihebi/helium2][open source]].

** USTC RoboGame 2012

I was the leader of a team in USTC RoboGame 2012, and we ranked 3rd
among 26 teams. The robot precisely fetched a bunch of flowers, found
routes using image processing, climbing the ladders, and finally put
the followers precisely in front of the sculpture of Jici Yan. The
micro controller was Freescale XS128. You can see
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0EbvINeiy4][a small video]] of our
robot in the competition that day. We also have a
[[file:assets/robogame2012-technical-report.pdf][technical report in
Chinese (pdf)]]

* Wiki

I use writing to refresh knowledge. More articles can be found on at
[[https://wiki.lihebi.com][wiki.lihebi.com]].  Disclaimer: these are
/my understandings/, not necessarily 100% correct. Read at your own
risk.

Programming has been a big part of my work, I'm particularly
passionate of writing [[file:wiki/functional.org][functional]]
programs and climbing the ladder of abstraction. The best language for
that is [[file:wiki/lisp.org][lisp]]. It is the ultimate meta language
that is ready for tuning as an ideal tool for any tasks, instead of
forcing you to think in its way. I believe programming and computing
has a basis on lisp, both the history and future. Other languages,
e.g. [[file:wiki/python.org][Python]], are helpful for collaborate
with people.

I started to use [[file:wiki/linux.org][Linux]] from 2011 when I got
my first laptop. I started with Vim initially, and catch up with
[[file:wiki/emacs.org][Emacs]] from 2015.

Some writings about [[file:wiki/ai.org][AI]] and
[[file:wiki/ml.org][ML]].

* Essays

I have this section to write down variety of my thoughts, for anyone
who wants to know what kind of person I am, and whether they want and
to get to know me and make friends or the other way around.

The essays are not finished, and will be consistently updated.

First of all, I document the [[file:quotes.org][quotes]] from the
great minds.

- [[file:essays/global-view.org][global view]]
- the [[file:essays/future.org][future]]
- [[file:essays/exponential-growth.org][exponential growth]]
- [[file:essays/time.org][life and time]]
- there is the whole [[file:essays/world.org][world]] out there
- [[file:essays/independence.org][Independence and collaboration]]

* Misc

I picked up skills for wooden projects and vehicle maintenance in the
US. I crafted a standing desk, a versatile workbench, a simple sofa
whose top is a slider for car engineering work. I have a Kawasaki
Ninja 300 and a miata for road trip, and do all the maintenance
myself, including replacement of engine oil and filter, transmission
oil, differential oil, coolant, spark plug, air filter, break fluid,
clutch fluid, and tire rotation.

I enjoyed traveling. I was driving along Road 1 in California along
San Diego and Los Angeles in 2015 Spring, experiencing Orlando
Universal Studio and cruising to Nassau in 2016 Winter, relaxing in
Las Vegas 2017 Spring.  I drove the round trip from Iowa to Seattle
2017 Summer.

Exercise brings me a lot of joy and energy. I finished
[[file:assets/finisher_certificate.pdf][full marathon (pdf)]] in 4h
35min, Oct 2017 at Des Moines. Catch me up this year on Oct 20 2018.
