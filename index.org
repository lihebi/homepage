# so busy yearning for the moon that he never saw the sixpence at his feet

If you look on the ground in search of a sixpence, you don't look up,
and so miss the moon. --- a 1956 letter from Maugham

I'm currently a PhD student in [[https://www.cs.iastate.edu/][CS@ISU]]
starting 2014 Fall.  I graduated from Electrical Engineering (1010) of
[[http://en.ustc.edu.cn/][USTC]] in 2014. See details in my
[[file:CV-Hebi.pdf][CV(pdf)]].

My research interests:
- Programming Language
- Artificial Intelligence
- Operating System
- Embedded system

** Program Analysis

Summer 2015 - Spring 2018

I was researching in Program Language and Analysis. We designed an
on-demand dynamic analysis framework.

# [[https://github.com/lihebi/helium2][open source]].

** USTC RoboGame

2012 Summer

I was the leader of a team in USTC RoboGame 2012, and we ranked 3rd among 26
teams. The robot precisely fetched a bunch of flowers, found routes using image
processing, climbing the ladders, and finally put the followers precisely in
front of the sculpture of Jici Yan. You can see [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0EbvINeiy4][a small video]] of our robot in
the competition that day. Check out the [[file:assets/robogame2012-proposal.pdf][proposal (pdf, chinese)]] and the
[[file:assets/robogame2012-technical-report.pdf][technical report (pdf, chinese)]].

* Wiki

This is a personal wiki, on various topics. An old archive of articles
can be found on at
[[https://wiki.lihebi.com][wiki.lihebi.com]]. Although I name it
"wiki", it is different from hyper-linked wikis aiming at connecting
concepts. Instead, these articles document highly integrated and
hierarchical knowledge, typically one big page per-topic. In this
sense it is more like a reference. There are many benefits of writing
a personal reference instead of using official ones:
1. I can control the granularity and focus on the topic 
2. possibly add my thoughts, and
3. a consistent writing style

* Essays

I have this section to write down variety of my thoughts, for anyone
who wants to know what kind of person I am, and whether they want and
to get to know me and make friends or the other way around.

The essays are not finished, and will be consistently updated.

First of all, I document the [[file:quotes.org][quotes]] from the
great minds.
