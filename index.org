I'm currently a PhD student in [[https://www.cs.iastate.edu/][CS@ISU]]
starting 2014 Fall.  I graduated from Electrical Engineering (1010) of
[[http://en.ustc.edu.cn/][USTC]] in 2014. See details in my
[[file:cv.pdf][CV(pdf)]].

You can find a list of my coding on
[[https://github.com/lihebi][GitHub@lihebi]].


* Projects

** Dynamic Analysis on Demand
I was researching in Program Language and Analysis from 2015 Summer to
2018 Spring. We designed an on-demand dynamic analysis framework,
called [[https://helium.lihebi.com][Helium]], and is
[[https://github.com/lihebi/helium2][open source]].

** USTC RoboGame 2012

I was the leader of a team in USTC RoboGame 2012, and we ranked 3rd
among 26 teams. The robot precisely fetched a bunch of flowers, found
routes using image processing, climbing the ladders, and finally put
the followers precisely in front of the sculpture of Jici Yan. The
micro controller was Freescale XS128. You can see
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0EbvINeiy4][a small video]] of our
robot in the competition that day.

* Wiki

I use writing to refresh knowledge. More articles can be found on at
[[https://wiki.lihebi.com][wiki.lihebi.com]].

Programming has been a big part of my work, I'm particularly
passionate of writing [[file:wiki/functional.org][functional]]
programs and climbing the ladder of abstraction. The best language for
that is [[file:wiki/lisp.org][lisp]]. It is a family of languages,
with [[file:wiki/common-lisp.org][Common Lisp]] and scheme
([[file:wiki/racket.org][racket]]) being the popular ones. It is the
ultimate meta language that is ready for tuning as an ideal tool for
any tasks, instead of forcing you to think in its way. I believe
programming and computing has a basis on lisp, both the history and
future. Other languages, e.g. [[file:wiki/python.org][Python]], are
helpful for collaborate with people.

I started to use [[file:wiki/linux.org][Linux]] from 2011 when I got
my first laptop. I started with Vim initially, and catch up with
[[file:wiki/emacs.org][Emacs]] from 2015.

* Misc

I picked up skills for wooden projects and vehicle maintenance in the
US. I crafted a standing desk, a versatile workbench, a simple sofa
whose top is a slider for car engineering work. I have a Kawasaki
Ninja 300 and a miata for road trip, and do all the maintenance
myself, including replacement of engine oil and filter, transmission
oil, differential oil, coolant, spark plug, air filter, break fluid,
clutch fluid, and tire rotation.

I enjoyed traveling. I was driving along Road 1 in California along
San Diego and Los Angeles in 2015 Spring, experiencing Orlando
Universal Studio and cruising to Nassau in 2016 Winter, relaxing in
Las Vegas 2017 Spring.  I drove the round trip from Iowa to Seattle
2017 Summer.

Exercise brings me a lot of joy and energy. I finished
[[file:assets/finisher_certificate.pdf][full marathon (pdf)]] in 4h
35min, Oct 2017 at Des Moines. Catch me up this year on Oct 20 2018.
