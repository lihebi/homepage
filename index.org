# so busy yearning for the moon that he never saw the sixpence at his feet

If you look on the ground in search of a sixpence, you don't look up,
and so miss the moon.

I'm currently a PhD student in [[https://www.cs.iastate.edu/][CS@ISU]]
starting 2014 Fall.  I graduated from Electrical Engineering (1010) of
[[http://en.ustc.edu.cn/][USTC]] in 2014. See details in my
[[file:cv.pdf][CV(pdf)]].

My (research) interests are quite broad:
- Programming Language (but not quite Software Engineering)
- Artificial (General) Intelligence (but not quite Machine Learning)
- Operating System (well, I mean Lisp Machines)
- Embedded system (IoT, robotics, you name it)



* Projects

** AI, Causality & NLP (Spring 2018 - Present)
Working ..
** Robotics (Spring 2018 - Present)
Working ..

** Dynamic Analysis on Demand (Summer 2015 - Spring 2018)
I was researching in Program Language and Analysis. We designed an
on-demand dynamic analysis framework.

# , called [[https://helium.lihebi.com][Helium]], and is
# [[https://github.com/lihebi/helium2][open source]].

** USTC RoboGame 2012

I was the leader of a team in USTC RoboGame 2012, and we ranked 3rd
among 26 teams. The robot precisely fetched a bunch of flowers, found
routes using image processing, climbing the ladders, and finally put
the followers precisely in front of the sculpture of Jici Yan. You can
see [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0EbvINeiy4][a small video]] of
our robot in the competition that day. Check out the
[[file:assets/robogame2012-proposal.pdf][proposal (pdf)]] and the
[[file:assets/robogame2012-technical-report.pdf][technical report
(pdf)]] in Chinese.

* Wiki

This is a personal wiki, on various topics. An old archive of articles
can be found on at
[[https://wiki.lihebi.com][wiki.lihebi.com]]. Although I name it
"wiki", it is different from hyper-linked wikis aiming at connecting
concepts. Instead, these articles document highly integrated and
hierarchical knowledge, typically one big page per-topic. In this
sense it is more like a reference. There are many benefits of writing
a personal reference instead of using official ones:
1. I can control the granularity and focus on the topic 
2. possibly add my thoughts, and
3. a consistent writing style

* Essays

I have this section to write down variety of my thoughts, for anyone
who wants to know what kind of person I am, and whether they want and
to get to know me and make friends or the other way around.

The essays are not finished, and will be consistently updated.

First of all, I document the [[file:quotes.org][quotes]] from the
great minds.

Exercise brings me a lot of joy and energy. I run full marathon every
year since 2017. See the
[[file:assets/finisher_certificate_2017.pdf][2017 certificate (pdf)]]
in 4h 35min and [[file:assets/finisher_certificate_2018.pdf][2018
certificate (pdf)]] in 4h 59min.
