Your time is limited, don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t
be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other people’s
thinking. Don’t let the noise of other opinions drown your own inner

intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to
become. Everything else is secondary.

differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree
with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is
ignore them because they change things… They push the human race
forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius,
because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change
the world, are the ones who do.

you’ll know when you find it.
#+END_QUOTE

life. School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half

even while you're still in it.
