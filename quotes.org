John F. Kennedy's

#+begin_quote
We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, *not because
they are easy, but because they are hard*; because that goal will serve to
organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge
is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one
we intend to win, and the others, too.
#+end_quote

Donald Knuth, in "Computer Programming as an Art" (1974),

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time
worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times;
*premature optimization is the root of all evil* (or at least most of
it) in programming.

CEO做决断的话，那么我觉得你至少要做到不要让大家不敢说话，不然你就没有信息吸收了。
理想情况下，你可能能够让，不仅你自己有学习机会和试错成本，你可以把这个机会和成本
分摊给团队成员，让他们也有学习机会和试错成本，让他们能做更多决断。

如果你的效率比对手高很多的话，其实通过单纯的烧钱能产生的竞争力是很小的。规模越大，
亏损越大。所以无论是烧钱还是不烧钱，都应该在效率的前提之下。

#+begin_quote
投资，在早期，更多的是艺术，不是科学，不是数据。八年以前，有多少人中午晚上吃外卖
的，多少人现在会去吃外卖，现在很多餐厅自己都在做外卖。什么叫艺术呢？就是你对这个
行业的想象力。你说这个团购行业有多大，咱们能不能量化一下，是两百亿呢还是两千亿呢，
还是两万亿？我感觉在当时你还真的很难去把它量化。

#+begin_quote
数学课上经常看英语书，然后看科幻世界，数学老师把我的书都撕掉了，然后扔到我脸上，
然后说你给我滚出去，你是全世界最差的学生。我后来想了想那个老师其实也挺无奈的，他
也很想帮助每个孩子，但是他没有这样的精力，和所谓的这样一个工具。
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
女性会给自己铁标签，就像胖子会觉得自己很胖，没信心，我从小就很胖，所以我是个胖子；
我原来这个高中没读完对吧，辍学这也是个标签。其实我觉得更多的是，我们自己不要给自
己贴标签，不要给自己设一个局限。可能创业这个事情，的确是有很大的冒险，运气成分在，
真正去做且做成的人，可能他们都需要一些共同的特质，这个特质其实不一定是男女的区别。

德州扑克里面其实最关键的问题就是，你其实真真正正你可能打二十把，能赢钱的就那两把。
就15分钟。这15分钟你是不是把注打够了。当你只有一点点的chips的时候，你如果不下注，
你光打底就死了。那在这个时候呢，我觉得是搏大的。就是需要在有胜算的时候all in进去。
我们在第6个月的时候，账面上就剩两三百万美元了。但是到那个位置了你不可能停下来嘛。
你补了5个月，你停下来，你不就证明自己错了吗。于情于理死撑也得撑着。晚上睡不着觉
我就不睡，我就起来跑步，我去跑一个小时，跑到筋疲力尽，我可以把自己累晕过去，但是
我在这种状态下我会保证一个好的睡眠。

#+begin_quote
人的成长过程中会有瓶颈，企业发展过程中会有瓶颈。解决瓶颈的唯一办法实际上是放弃。
这个时候你就像一个抛物线，当你意识到你已经走向了抛物线的顶端的时候，应该大胆去寻
找第二条抛物线。

Jeff Bezos in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ][an interview video on Regret Minimization Framework]]:

#+begin_quote
(My boss says) (selling book online) sounds like really a good idea to me. But
it sounds like a BETTER idea for somebody who DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE A GOOD
JOB. Hahahahahhahahahhahahah
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say okay now I'm looking back
on my life I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have. And I knew
that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was now going
to regret having tring to participate in this thing called the internet that I
thought was going to be a really big deal. And I knew that if I failed, I
wouldn't regret that. But I knew one thing I might regret is not ever having
tried and I knew that that would haunt me every day. So when I thought about it
that way, it was an incredibly easy decision, and I think that's very good if
you can project yourself out to the age 80, and think what will I think at that
time, it gets you away from some of the daily pieces of confusion.

** Steve Jobs
2010 interview:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
What I love about the consumer market, that I always hated about the
enterprise market, is that we come up with a product, we try to tell
everybody about it, and every person votes for themselves. They go
'yes' or 'no,' and if enough of them say 'yes,' we get to come to work
tomorrow. That's how it works. It's really simple. With the enterprise
market, it's not so simple. The people that use the products don't
decide for themselves, and the people that make those decisions
sometimes are confused. We love just trying to make the best products
in the world for people and having them tell us by how they vote with
their wallets whether we're on track or not.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Just because we're competing with someone doesn't mean we have to be rude.

From Steve Jobs’ Commencement address on June 12, 2005:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My third story is about death.

When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: *“If you live
each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be
right.”* It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33
years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself:
*“If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am
about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many
days in a row, I know I need to change something.*

Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve
ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because
*almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of
embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of
death, leaving only what is truly important.* Remembering that you are
going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
have something to lose. *You are already naked. There is no reason not
to follow your heart.*

About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in
the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t
even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost
certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect
to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go
home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare
to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d
have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to
make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as
possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a
biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my
stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got
a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there,
told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors
started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of
pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and
I’m fine now.

This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the
closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can
now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a
useful but purely intellectual concept:

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want
to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No
one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is
very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change
agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the
new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually
become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is
quite true.

*Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s
life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of
other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown
out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to
follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you
truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.*

Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers,
the round pegs in the square holes… The ones who see things
differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree
with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is
ignore them because they change things… They push the human race
forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius,
because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change
the world, are the ones who do.

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way
to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the
only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found
it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart,
you’ll know when you find it.

It's important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not
life. School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half

thing. It's only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it
even while you're still in it.
