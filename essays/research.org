#+TITLE: Research

From Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) dream by J.C.R. Licklider:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- *really advance* something *very important*
- vision not goals
- fund people not project
- only fund the very best people
- it's a research community, not research project
- fund problem findings, not just problem solving
- milestones not deadlines
- it's baseball, not golf (??)
- if you can make your own tools, HW, and SW, then you must.
- argue for clarity, not to win
- an important part of the research results are new and better researchers
- the reaching is the reward
#+END_QUOTE


The research topics I think is important to work on:

- Quantum Computing
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- Space, Universe
- Programming Language (Lisp)

The not-so-research topics I think worth working on:
- Operating System in Lisp
- Internet of Things (equipped with the OS above)
- Self driving cars
- Flying cars
- Device that empower human physically
  - artificial muscle that enhance strength
  - personal aircraft/airwear
  - personal drone
