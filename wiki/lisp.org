#+TITLE: Lisp Index Page

This is the lisp index page, containing general staff for lisp.

There's a [[http://hyperpolyglot.org/lisp][page]] for corresponding
APIs of common lisp, racket, clojure, emacs lisp.

* Introduction

** Dialects

Richard P. Gabriel has a [[http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Technical-Issues.html][paper]] about Lisp-1 and Lisp-2. Basically
Lisp-1 has seperate namespace for functions and variables, while
Lisp-2 only have one universal namespace.

Lisp-1 includes Elisp, [[file:common-lisp.org][Common Lisp]]. All
scheme are lisp-2.  [[file:racket.org][Racket]] is the modern scheme
with batteries.


** Why Lisp?
As Peter Norvig put in [[https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp][Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming]]

- adapt the language to your prolem
  - you can make DSL for your specific topic
  - support whatever programming style by just defining some macros
  - the basic and universal data structure: list
- developing lisp is fast
  - dynamic, define function during running
  - REPL

#+begin_quote
There is a myth that Lisp is "special-purpose" languages, while
languages like Pascal and C are "general purpose". Actually, just the
reverse is true.

** CASE

David J. Cooper in /Basic Lisp Techniques/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Many developers once hoped that the software development process of
the future would be more automated through Computer-aided Software
Engineering (CASE) tools. Such tools claim to enable programmers and
non-programmers to diagram their applications visually and
automatically generate code. While useful to a certain extent,
traditional CASE tools cannot cover domain-specific details and
support all possible kinds of customizations — so developers
inevitably need to hand-code the rest of their applications, breaking
the link between the CASE model and the code. CASE systems fall short
of being a true “problem solving tool.”

The recursive nature of CL, and its natural ability to build
applications in layers and build upon itself — in essence, code which
writes code which writes code..., makes CL a much better software
engineering solution. CL programs can generate other CL programs
(usually at compile-time), allowing the developer to define all parts
of the application in one unified high-level language. Using macros
and functions, naturally supported by the CL syntax, the system can
convert applications written in the high-level language automatically
into “final” code. Thus, CL is both a programming language and a
powerful CASE tool, and there is no need to break the connection.

** fold & unfold

#+begin_quote
In academic functional programming literature, folds are often called
catamorphisms, unfolds are often called anamorphisms, and the
combinations of the two are often called hylomorphisms. They're
interesting because any for-each loop can be represented as a
catamorphism. To convert from a loop to a foldl, package up all
mutable variables in the loop into a data structure (records work well
for this, but you can also use an algebraic data type or a list). The
initial state becomes the accumulator; the loop body becomes a
function with the loop variables as its first argument and the
iteration variable as its second; and the list becomes, well, the
list. The result of the fold function is the new state of all the
mutable variables.

Similarly, every for-loop (without early exits) can be represented as
a hylomorphism. The initialization, termination, and step conditions
of a for-loop define an anamorphism that builds up a list of values
for the iteration variable to take. Then, you can treat that as a
for-each loop and use a catamorphism to break it down into whatever
state you wish to modify.
#+end_quote


** Car & Cdr
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The names CAR and CDR derive from the history of Lisp.  The original
Lisp implementation ran on an IBM 704 computer which divided words into
two parts, called the “address” part and the “decrement”; CAR was an
instruction to extract the contents of the address part of a register,
and CDR an instruction to extract the contents of the decrement.  By
contrast, “cons cells” are named for the function ‘cons’ that creates
them, which in turn was named for its purpose, the construction of
cells.
#+END_QUOTE


** The right thing vs. Worse is better [fn:1]
These are two software design philosophies. The key different is:
- The right thing: interface should be simple
- Worse is better: implementation should be simple

#+begin_quote
The worse-is-better philosophy means that implementation simplicity
has highest priority, which means Unix and C are easy to port on such
machines.

Unix and C are the ultimate computer viruses.

The code will be portable because it is written on top of a virus.

The good news is that in 1995 we will have a good operating system and
programming language; the bad news is that they will be Unix and C++.

* Emacs IDE
** Geiser
All REPL evaluation happens in a module, and the module of the REPL is
typically different from that of a file.

In the REPL, the module name is shown in REPL right after =@= sign. If
you are not in the right module, you cannot access the bindings
defined in it. You can switch the module by =switch-to-geiser-module
(C-c C-m)=, which is implemented as =,m=, =,use=, or =,enter=,
depending on the scheme implementation. You can also import the
bindings of a module into the current namespace, using
=geiser-repl-import-module (C-c C-i)=.

In a file, the module is the current file. If you evaluate something,
it will most likely output results in minibuffer, unless
1. an error happens, where you are dropped in the REPL in debugger
   mode with the module of the file, so that you can access all the
   bindings there. Just remember to =,q= when you are done.
2. output images, which will be shown in the REPL, but no entry of
   debugger
3. a warning happens. The warning will be in a separate buffer, and
   will not drop you in debugger.

Some of the useful commands:
- =C-c C-z=: jump to repl, start if not started.
- =C-c C-d d=: read document for symbol
- =C-c C-d i=: read the manual (more comprehensive) for symbol
- =C-c C-d m=: read the list of exported bindings in a module (enter)
- =C-x C-e=: evaluate last sexp
- =C-x C-b=: evaluate buffer
- =C-x C-r=: evaluate region
- =C-M-x=: eval top level
- =C-c \= runs the command =geiser-insert-lambda=, inserts a
  lambda. As a comparison, the racket-mode has
  =racket-unicode-input-method-enable=, implemented an input method
  for all latin letters.

* Racket
** Basic
*** Local binding
The local binding is established by =let= family. Apart from normal
=let=, racket has a second form, known as *named let*.

#+begin_example
(let proc-id ([id init-expr] ...) body ...+)
#+end_example

It first evaluates the init-exprs, the resulting values become
arguments to *an application of a procedure*.

#+begin_example
(lambda (id ...) body ...+)
#+end_example

Within the body, =proc-id= is bound to the procedure itself.

#+begin_src racket
  (let fac ([n 10])
    (if (zero? n) 1
        (* n (fac (sub1 n)))))
#+end_src

*** require
=require= introduces bindings. It can only be used in two context, the
top-level context, or the module context (in which it introduce module
bindings).

To require a installed module, use =(lib "rel-string")=, and its
widely used shorthand =(require id)= where id is the unquoted string.

When requiring a local file, use plain relative (to current directory)
path in a string. The path should NOT start or end with a slash. It
seems that the suffix is optional.

To use a absolute path, you have to use =(file string)=, and
=expand-user-path= is called, so you can use:
- relative path
- tide home directory
- absolute path

The =#lang= is a shorthand.
#+begin_src racket
#lang racket
decl ...
;; equivalent to
(module name racket
  decl ...)
#+end_src

Where name is the file name.


** Black Magic
http://www.greghendershott.com/2015/07/keyword-structs-revisited.html
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (begin-for-syntax
    (define syntax->keyword (compose1
                             string->keyword
                             symbol->string
                             syntax->datum)))
#+END_SRC

** Pattern Matching (racket/match)
The syntax:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (match val-expr clause ...)

  clause = [pat [#:when cond-expr] body ...+]
#+END_SRC
cond-expr is in teh scope of pat (to have the bind or not??).

The clauses are checked one-by-one, and the body of first match will
be in the tail position.

Pattern can be
- =_= to match anything and abandon it.
- a single id which matches anything and bind to it. An ID can appear
  more than once, in which case the pattern is considered matching
  only if all of the bindings of ID are same.
  - e.g. =(list a b a)= will not match ='(1 2 3)=, but will match ='(1
    2 1)=
- a list which binds to the destruction. 
- The quote can not be used to construct list of symbols, it will
  match verbatically instead. For that, use quasiquote, which supports
  the evaluation and splice-eval.
  - e.g. =`(1 ,a ,b)= will match ='(1 2 3)= with =a= and =b= bound.
- hash-table can be used to match the key and values, Using =...= in
  it means collect into a list.
  - e.g. =(hash-table ("key1" a) ("key2" b))=.
  - e.g. =(hash-table (key val) ...)= will match =#hash(("a" . 1) ("b"
    . 2))=, and key will be ='("b" "a")=
- cons can be used to match pairs
- =struct-id= can be used to match fields by position. Use =(struct
  struct-id _)= to match an instance of structure itself. E.g.
  - for structure =(struct tree (val left right))=
  - pattern =(tree a (tree b  _ _) _)= will match
  - =(tree 0 (tree 1 #f #f) #f)=
  - with =a= bound to 0, =b= bound to 1
- =(and pat ...)= is used to combine a list of patterns. The typical usage is
  =(and id pat)= where you can bind =id= and still check the =pat=
  against the entire value. =or= is also available but not that
  useful.
- =(? expr pat ...)=: combine a predicate and the =and=
  pattern. I.e. first, apply =expr= on the value to match, if =#t=,
  the additional =pat= are matched using the above =and= pattern.

There are some syntax sugar for matching:
- =(match-lambda clause ...)=: equivalent to =(lambda (id) (match id
  clause ...))=

** Macros
Matthias Felleisen boils down macros into three main categories:
1. Binding form
2. Change order of evaluation
3. Make DSLs

Different from common lisp where you have compile time and runtime,
racket has the concept called /level/. The level 0 is roughly runtime,
and level 1 is compile time. But there're also level -1 and level 2,
3, ..., thus it is more general. But typically the first two levels
are used.

When using racket syntax, you typically need to require the base
library for it, by =(require (for-syntax racket/base))=.

Everything boils down to =define-syntax= and =syntax-case=.
=define-syntax= is nothing fancy. It just define a binding, same as
define, but the binding is in effect at level 1. Thus actually we
typically still define it as a lambda expression, thus it has the
shorthand to write argument (stx) in the same line. =syntax-rules=
itself is a lambda expression surounding =syntax-case=. Thus second
form does not use syntax-rules, but use syntax-case directly.

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (define-syntax foo
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((_ a ...) (printf "~a\n" (list a ...)))))
  ;; <=>
  (define-syntax (foo stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      (_ a ...)
      #'(printf "~a\n" (list a ...))))
#+END_SRC

=syntax-case= match a given syntax object against patterns, and return
another syntax object. It is doing the transformation. You can
actually do the transformation yourself, using =sytax->datum=,
operates on it, and use =datum->syntax= to convert it back. So
=syntax-case= just provides an easier way to do that, in the sense
that you don't need to convert explicitly. Instead, you specify by
position the argument, to match the datum, and construct a syntax
object as a result.

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (syntax-case stx-expr (literal-id ...)
    [pattern result-expr] ...)
#+END_SRC

Note the result is =result-expr=, that means the expr is going to be
executed, and the return value should be a syntax object.

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (define-syntax (foo stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(_ a b c)
       #'(if a b c)]))
#+END_SRC

See, stx is matched against the pattern =(_ a b c)=, and
destructed. =a b c= can then be used to construct the returned syntax
object. Note, the return must be a syntax object, it replaces the (foo
xxx) and be evaluated. The first is =_= because we don't care about
the leading identifier =#'foo=.

=syntax-rules= is a lambda expression, that calls =syntax-case= to
return a syntax object. It is used to define multiple patterns and
templates at one time. Note that the result is a "template" instead of
"expr", meaning it is restricted: cannot run any code, merely return
the template as if quoted. Thus when using syntax-rules, the result
need not be quoted by =syntax=.

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (syntax-rules (literal-id ...)
    [(id . pattern) template] ...)
  ;; <=>
  (lambda (stx)
    (syntax-case stx (literal-id ...)
      [(generated-id . pattern) (syntax-protect #'template)] ...))
#+END_SRC

=define-syntax-rule= is shorthand for =define-syntax= and
=syntax-rules=. The pattern is a list, the first is an identifier, the
following are pattern variables that matches anything. The template is
the constructed form to replace the old form. It is not quoted,
because it uses syntax-rules to construct. All pattern variables will
be replaced by the actual form.

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (define-syntax-rule (id . pattern) template)
  ;; <=>
  (define-syntax id
    (syntax-rules ()
      [(id . pattern) template]))
#+END_SRC
This is so constrained. The following is equivalent to the above:
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (define-syntax-rule (foo a b c)
    (if a b c))
#+END_SRC

=with-syntax= is often used to nest syntax. It is like =let= but is
able to bind pattern variables.
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(syntax-case <syntax> () [<pattern> <body>] ...)
(syntax-case (list stx-expr ...) () [(pattern ...) (let () body ...+)])
;; <=>
(with-syntax ([<pattern> <stx-expr>] ...) <body> ...+)
#+END_SRC

*** Reader
To understand how macro works, we need to know how the reader handles
the program.

A datum is the basic output of a read. Datum can be compound, in which
case the reader is recursively read the components. Some datums are
interned by the reader, i.e. their values are always =eq?= when they
are =equal?=. Such datums includes: symbols, keywords, strings, byte
strings, regexps, characters, numbers.

Some special read notation:
- =#(1 2 3)= for vectors
- =#s(struct-id 1 2 3)= for prefab structure types. note that for
  complex structure, the print format is not intuitive.
- =#hash(("a" . 5) ("b" b))= for hash tables
*** Syntax Model
A /syntax object/ is a simple racket value + scope set + phase level.

When require something, those functions are not visible in
level 1. Thus if you want to use those when macro expands, you need
=(reqire (for-syntax racket/base))=.  Similarly, =for-meta= can be
used to specify any number as shift level.

Similaryly, a top-level =begin= is not visible in macro, we need
=begin-for-syntax= to bind variables to use at level 1.

Use these to expand a macro:
- =(expand top-level-form)=: fully expand
- =(expand-once top-level-form)=: expand only once

Here's an example from Racket Guide that implements call-by-reference

Should generate
#+begin_src racket
(define (do-f get-a get-b put-a! put-b!)
  (define-get/put-id a get-a put-a!)
  (define-get/put-id b get-b put-b!)
  (swap a b))
(do-f (lambda () x)
      (lambda () y)
      (lambda (v) (set! x v))
      (lambda (v) (set! y v)))
#+end_src

The test code:
#+begin_src racket
  (define-cbr (f a b)
    (swap a b))

  (let ([x 1] [y 2])
    (f x y)
    (list x y))
#+end_src

The actual implementation:
#+begin_src racket
  (define-syntax-rule (define-get/put-id id get put!)
    (define-syntax id
      (make-set!-transformer
       (lambda (stx)
         (syntax-case stx (set!)
           [id (identifier? (syntax id)) (syntax (get))]
           [(set! id e) (syntax (put! e))])))))

  (define-syntax-rule (define-cbr (id arg ...) body)
    (begin
      (define-syntax id
        (syntax-rules ()
          [(id actual (... ...))
           (do-f (lambda () actual)
                 (... ...)
                 (lambda (v)
                   (set! actual v))
                 (... ...))]))
      (define-for-cbr do-f (arg ...)
        () ; explained below...
        body)))

  (define-syntax define-for-cbr
    (syntax-rules ()
      [(define-for-cbr do-f (id0 id ...)
         (gens ...) body)
       (define-for-cbr do-f (id ...)
         (gens ... (id0 get put)) body)]
      [(define-for-cbr do-f ()
         ((id get put) ...) body)
       (define (do-f get ... put ...)
         (define-get/put-id id get put) ...
         body)]))
#+end_src

The define-for-cbr is pretty tricky, the following =with-syntax= is
better:
#+begin_src racket
  (define-syntax (define-for-cbr stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(_ do-f (id ...) body)
       (with-syntax ([(get ...) (generate-temporaries #'(id ...))]
                     [(put ...) (generate-temporaries #'(id ...))])
         #'(define (do-f get ... put ...)
             (define-get/put-id id get put) ...
             body))]))
#+end_src


*** Hygienic
A very good writing about syntax-case, and how to (NOT) write
non-hygienic macros.
http://blog.racket-lang.org/2011/04/writing-syntax-case-macros.html


- a syntax object is a plain datum with some lexical context
  information
- =syntax->datum= accepts one syntax object, and return the raw list
- =datum->syntax= accepts one context syntax object to donor its
  context, and a plain datum to be converted.
- scheme macro is hygienic, i.e.
  1. if it inserts a binding, it will be renamed through its lexical
     scope
  2. if it refers a free variable, it refers to the one in scope in
     which *the definition of the macro* happens.

Thus, to break the hygienic

#+begin_src racket
(define-syntax (while stx)
  (syntax-case stx ()
    [(_ test body ...)
     (syntax-case (datum->syntax stx 'it) ()
       [it #'(let loop ()
               (let ([it test])
                 (when it
                   body ...
                   (loop))))])]))

#+end_src

or using =with-syntax= to bind pattern variable:
#+begin_src racket
(define-syntax (while stx)
  (syntax-case stx ()
    [(_ test body ...)
     (with-syntax ([it (datum->syntax stx 'it)])
       #'(let loop ()
           (let ([it test])
             (when it
               body ...
               (loop)))))]))
#+end_src

This is primarily used to introduce a binding that is visible to the
outside world. It seems that /syntax parameters/ can do that better.

     


** Rackunit
Since racket has the =test= module concept, there needs no unit test
framework. However, it seems that =rackunit= provides some
predicate functions.

In racket, each file is a module with the file name as the module
name. You can define a submodule using =module*= and =module+=. The
former can only appear exactly once for each module, while the latter
can appear multiple times, all of them concatenated into a single
module as if using =module*=.

Thus, folks typically use =module*= to define a =main= module, which
will be run by racket after the enclosing module by
=racket=. =module+= is used to define =test= modules, and will be
executed by =raco test= command.

=rackunit= provides check APIs and also organize tests into cases and
suites.  A check is a simple check, like equality. A test case is a
group of checks. If one of them fails, the following will not be
executed, and the test case fails. A suite is a group of test cases,
and has a name.

Check APIs (all of them accepts an optional message at the end):
- =check-eq?=
- =check-not-eq?=
- =check-equal?=
- =check-not-equal?=
- =check-pred pred v=: check if apply pred on v will produce
  other than #f
- ~check-= v1 v2 epsilon~: |v1-v2| <= epsilon
- =check-true v=: #t
- =check-false v=: #f
- =check-not-flase v=: not #f
- =check op v1 v2=: generic form, op is =(-> any any any)=
- =fail=: fail unconditionally, useful when developing to mark some tests

The following does not accept message, because they are straightforward:
- =check-match v pattern=: check if v match pattern

=test-begin expr ...= is used to group exprs, while =test-case name
body ...+= accept a name for them, and get reported if test fails.

Test suites are not going to run by default. This allows you to
specify which tests to run. There're text (=run-tests= in
=rackunit/text-ui=) and gui (=test/gui= in =rackunit/gui=) interfaces
to select tests. Create a suite using =(test-suite name-expr test
...)=. The tests can be single check or a test case.

** Numbers
- =/=: provide the fraction if given two numbers, not to round it.
- =quotient n m=: =(truncate (/ n m))=
- =remainder n m=: seems that the result has the same sign with n
- =modulo n m=: seems that the result has the same sign with m
- =add1=
- =sub1=
- =abs=
- =max=
- =min=
- =gcd=
- =lcm=: least common multiple
- =round=
- =floor=
- =ceiling=
- =truncate=: towards 0
- =numerator=
- =denominator=

Computation
- =sqrt=
- =expt e p=: e to the power of p
- =exp z=
- =log z [b (exp 1)]=

Random
- =random k=: =[0,k)=
- =random min max=: =[min,max)=
- =random-seed k=

With =racket/random=:
- =random-sample seq n=

** Procedure
The =define= keyword can be used to bind a id to a variable, but most
likely you are binding a procedure. So the syntax for arguments
matters.

#+begin_example
  (define (head args) body ...+)
  args = arg ... | arg ... . rest-id
  arg = arg-id
      | [arg-id default-expr]
      | keyword arg-id
      | keyword [arg-id default-expr]
#+end_example

Note how the rest-id are used to implement the =...= by using one dot.

The context matters. In an internal-definition context, a =define=
binds a local binding. At top level, it introduces /top-level
binding/.

In application of procedures, =apply= will apply the procedure with
content of the list as argument, thus the procedure must accept *as
many parameters as* the length of list. The list is actually more
flexible, i.e. collected using =list*=.

=compose= accepts one or more procedures, and composes them by
applying one by one, and fold result into parameter to the next. The
last procedure is applied first. There're two versions, =compose=
allow arbitrary number of values to be passed between procedure calls,
as long as the number of results and parameters match. =compose1=
restricts this to exactly one value.


** Control Structure
- =if=
- =(cond [test-expr then-body ...+] ...)=

#+begin_example
  (cond cond-clause ...)
  cond-clause = [test-expr then-body ...+]
              | [else then-body ...+]
              | [test-expr => proc-expr]
              | [test-expr]
#+end_example

- =and=: A typically trick: =(and (some expr) #t)= to return a boolean
  value
  - if no expr, return =#t=
  - one expr, return its value in tail position.
  - Multiple exprs
    - if first eval to =#f=, return #f
    - *otherwise* recursive call with the rest of exprs in tail
      position.

- =test-expr => proc-expr=: =proc-expr= must *produce* a procedure
  that accept exactly *one* argument, the result of =test-expr= is
  that argument. The value is returned.
- =test-expr= without a body will return the result of
  =test-expr=. Not in tail position.

- =(case val-expr [(datum ...) then-body ...+] ...)=: if val-expr
  matches one of datum, execute the body
- =when=
- =unless=
- =(for ([id seq-expr] #:when guard-expr #:unless guard-expr) body)=
- =for/list=, =for/vector=, =for/hash=
- =for/and=, =for/or=
- =for/sum=, =for/product=
- =for/first=, =for/last=
- =for/fold=
- =for*=: like for, but with implicit #:when #t between each
  pair. Thus all clauses are nested. =for*= also has the form of
  different return values.

** String
The reading syntax of characters starts with =#\=, with following
forms

** structure
#+begin_example
struct id maybe-super (field ...) struct-option ...
field = field-id | [field-id field-option ...]
#+end_example

The =struct= form creates a structure type (unless =#:prefab= is
specified), and some names (along with others). Now we use =myid= as
the provided id:
- =struct:myid=: the /structure type descriptor/, can be used in
  =#:super= option
- =myid=: constructor, unless =#:constructor-name= option is specified
- =myid?=: predicate procedure
- =myid-myfield=: accessor procedure for each field

*** Field options
There are two available field options:
- =#:auto=: automatic fields: the constructor does not accept argument
  for that field, the auto value by =#:auto-value= (defaults to =#f=)
  is used.
- =#:mutable=: =set-myid-myfield!=: destructively update field. A
  mutable field is defined in *one* of two ways: defined for the
  fields with =#:mutable= option, or struct option =#:mutable= for all
  fields. Specify both results in syntax error.

*** Subtyping
You can specify super class in *one* of two ways: maybe-super or via
=#:super= option. Specify both results in syntax error.  Subtype will
inherit fields, when initialize, initialize those parent fields first.

*** Structure options
- =#:mutable=: same as set =#:mutable= for all fields
- =#:super=: same as set maybe-super
- =#:prefab=: means /previously fabricated/. Also known as predefined,
  globally shared. Such structure types are globally shared, and they
  can be print and read back. If it has a super class, obviously it
  must also be prefab. It is inherently transparent, and cannot have a
  guard or property. I.e. it cannot be used together with
  =#:transparent=, =#:inspector=, =#:guard=, =#:property=.
- =#:auto-value=: supply *one* value for all =#:auto= fields
- =#:transparent=: shorthand for =#:inspector #f=. All structures are
  by default opaque, thus the print out format does not show any
  information. If the structure is transparent, the print information
  can see the data. The =equal?= will also works by recursively
  compare all fields, while for opaque structures, this require to
  define generic method for =equal?=. However, the prints cannot be
  read back, to do which the prefab is required.
- =#:inspector= specify an inspector. This is intended for use by
  debuggers. It is related to reflection, i.e. providing access to
  structure fields and structure type information.
- =#:guard= specify a guard procedure, or just =#f= to turn it
  off. This is used to filter the arguments to constructor. It accepts
  n+1 arguments: the n constructor arguments, plus the name of the
  structure, and return n arguments that is actually used for
  construction. It is called "guard" in the sense that it can raise
  exceptions.
- =#:property=: this can be specified multiple times for multiple
  properties. A property is associated with the type, not the
  instance. Subtype will inherit property, and can override it. The
  usage is TODO, and how to retrieve is also TODO.
- =#:methods=: TODO

*** Generic Interface

require =racket/generic=.

First define the interface.
#+begin_src racket
(define-generics printable
  (gen-print printable port)
  (gen-port-print port printable)
  (gen-print* printable [port] #:width width #:height height))
#+end_src

We are defining a generic id called =printable=. The =gen:printable=
will be the transformer binding used when defining the structure. The
followings are the methods that are supposed to be defined. Note:
there must be a =printable= literally in each of these methods. It
does not matter which position, but this particular position should be
kept as the variable in your actual definition. The arguments are
nothing new, including optional variable, default values, as well as
keyword arguments.

Define the structure. To declare that this structure satisfies a
generic interface, specify it in =#:methods=. It accepts two values:
=gen:name=, and =method-defs=. You can supply multiple =#:methods= of
course. Each of the def is a define of the function, very normal. Note
that the variable that corresponds to the =printable=, by position, is
the data object. Since there cannot be duplicate arguments, you cannot
use this twice (this of course is not likely what you want).

There's a =define/generic= that has a fixed form of two arguments,
=local-id= and =method-id=. The latter can only be one of these
generic method. It is the form used to create a binding. Using just
define cannot create this, because =gen-print= will not be in
scope. And =define/generic= can only be used here. And interestingly
inside a generic function, the =gen-print= is in scope, and can be
bound by a =let= expression (why??).

#+begin_src racket
(struct num (v)
  #:methods gen:printable
  [(define/generic alias gen-print)
   (define/generic alias2 gen-print*)
   ;; (define alias3 gen-print)
   (define (gen-print n port)
     (fprintf port "Num: ~a" (num-v n)))
   (define (gen-port-print port n)
     (let ([alias2 gen-print]) 
       (gen-print n port)
       (alias n port)
       ;; (alias2 n)
       ;; (alias3 n port)
       ))])
#+end_src

Use like this:
#+begin_src racket
(gen-port-print (current-output-port) (num 8) )
#+end_src



** Multiple Values
values produce multiple values value, to consume that, typically use
=let-values=, =let*-values=, =define-values=. Also, binding forms that
can destruct values can also be used.

** Exception
For now, I only care about how to handle exceptions. To do that:

- call-with-exception-handler f thunk: (f ex)
- with-handlers ([pred-expr handler-expr] ...) body ...+
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (with-handlers ([exn:fail:syntax?
                   (λ (e) (displayln "got a syntax error"))]
                  [exn:fail?
                   (λ (e) (displayln "fallback clause"))])
    (raise-syntax-error #f "a syntax error"))
#+END_SRC

Here's the hierarchy of built-in exceptions
- exn
  - exn:fail
    - exn:fail:contract
    - exn:fail:syntax
    - exn:fail:read
    - exn:fail:filesystem
    - exn:fail:network
    - exn:fail:out-of-memory
    - exn:fail:unsupported
    - exn:fail:user
  - exn:break

To raise an exception, you can use:
- =raise=: too general, don't use for now
- =error=: raise exn:fail
- =raise-user-error=
- =raise-syntax-error=

** Concurrency
Comparison
- Thread: all the threads are running parallel, but they run on the
  /same processor/.
- Future: can utilize multiple processors

Thread
- =thread thunk=: create a thread to run, and return immediately with
  thread descriptor. When thunk terminates, the thread
  terminates. Threads are managed in current custodian.
- =thread?=
- =current-thread=
- =thread-suspend=
- =thread-resume=
- =kill-thread=
- =break-thread=
- ~sleep [secs=0]~: cause the current thread to sleep. 0 simply hint
  other threads to execute (useful??).
- =thread-running?=
- =thread-dead?=
- =thread-wait thd=: block until thd terminates
- =thread-send thd v=
- =thread-receive=: block until a v is ready
- =thread-try-receive=: non-block version

Parameters are procedures, which optionally accepts one argument. If
no argument, get the value. Given the arguement, set the value. This
is like a global variable, thus suitable for a command line option
storage. The parameters are local to thread, and sub thread inherit
parent ones, but not shared. This means setting the parameter will not
affect the parameter in other thead (including parent thread).

To make a parameter, simply:
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define aaa (make-parameter #f))
(aaa) ; => #f
(aaa 3)
(aaa) ; => 3
#+END_SRC

Parameters are often used by parameterize it in some content, instead
of set directly.

#+begin_example
(parameterize ([param value-expr] ...)
  body ...+)
#+end_example


Future (=racket/future=)
- =future thunk=: return the future. It will not run, until touch it.
- =touch f=: blockingly run the future f, and return the result. After
  touch returns, the results are still hold in the future. You can
  touch it again and retrieve the same result. Then, how to run in
  parallel? Create a thread to touch it??
- =current-future=
- =future-enabled?=
- =future?=
- =processor-count=
- =for/async (for-clause ...) body ...+=

Places can also use multiple cores. Place enables greater parallelism
than future, because it creates a new racket VM, and include separate
garbage collection. Thus the setup and communication cost is higher.
Places can only communicate through place channels.

** IO
*** ports
**** General operation
- =eof=: global variable
- =eof-object?=
- =close-input-port=, =close-output-port=
- =current-input-port=, =current-output-port=, =current-error-port=:
  can be used to get/set the current
- =flush-output out=: Input or output ports are both block-buffered by
  default. Terminal output port is line-buffered. This function cause
  the port to be flushed immediately

**** File IO
- =open-input-file path [#:mode flag]=: return an input port. mode can
  be ='binary= or ='text=
- =open-output-file path [#:mode flag #:exists flag]=: exist flag
  includes
  - error
  - append
  - replace: remove old file, create a new one
- =open-input-output-file path [#:mode flag #:exists flag]=
- =call-with-input-file path proc=: proc is =(input-port? . ->
  . any)=. When proc returns, the port is closed.
- =call-with-output-file path proc=
- =with-input-from-file path thunk=: set =current-input-port= to
  file. As it is similar to =call-with-input-file=, the port is closed
  when thunk returns.
- =with-output-to-file path thunk=

**** String IO
- =open-input-string str=: create a string port using str
- =open-output-string=: create a output string port
- =get-output-string out=: read from a output string port. This should
  be used with the above method, specifically the out should be
  =(and/c output-port? string-port?)=.

**** Extra
Requires =racket/port=. This is actually the most commonly used
helpers. All of these have bytes counterparts.

- *=port->string=*
- =port->lines=
- =display-lines=
- =call-with-output-string proc=: proc: =(output-port? . -> . any)=
- =with-output-to-string proc=: proc is =(-> any)=

- =with-input-from-string str proc=: proc is =(-> any)=



*** Reading
- =read-char=
- =read-byte=
- =read-line=
- =read-bytes-line=
- =read=: read a /datum/ from an input port
- =read-syntax=: like read, but produce a /syntax object/, with
  source-location information

*** Writing
- =write-char=
- =write-byte=
- =newline=
- =write-string=
- =write-bytes=

- =write=: write a datum so that it can be read back
- =display=: write string without the quotes
- =print=: this is pretty weird. The existence rationale is that,
  /display and write both have specific output convention/. But print
  has no pre-assumed convention, and the environment is free to modify
  its behavior.
- =writeln=, =displayln=, =println=
- =fprintf out form v ...=
  - out is an output port
  - form is a format string.
    - =~n=: new line
    - =~a=: display
    - =~s=: write
    - =~v=: print
- =printf form v ...=: equivalent to =fprintf (current-output-port) form v ...=
- =eprintf form v ...=: print to (current-error-port)
- =format form v ...=: return the string

  user path.
- =cleanse-path=: most racket functions clean the path before use,
  unless it does not access filesystem (i.e. onlyl do a form
  checking). =cleanse-path=, =expand-user-path=, =simplify-path= are
  exceptions in the sense that they does not access filesystem, but
  will do cleanse. But what exactly cleanse does?
- *=expand-user-path=*: a leading =~= is replaced by the user home
  directory.
- =simplify-path=: nomalize as much as possible. I.e. remove
  - redundant path separators (except single trailing separator)
  - =..=, =.=
- *=split-path=*: remove the last component (without consideration of
  trailing =/=, as we will see in the 3rd return value), and return 3
  values (e.g. "aa/bb/cc/"):
  - base: =aa/bb/=
  - name: =cc=
  - must-be-dir?: =#t=
- =explode-path=: split path extensively, the first one is root
- *=path-replace-extension path ext=*: extension starts from the last
  dot. =ext= should lead by a dot. If no dot in the path, simply add
  it.
- =path-add-extension path ext [sep #"_"]=: add the extension. If
  there's a dot in the path, the last dot will be replaced by sep.

- *=current-directory=* get or set, this is a parameter
- *=directory-exists?=*
- =make-directory=
- =delete-directory=
- *=directory-list [path #:build build?]=*: list of all files or
  directories in =path=. path defaults to current directory, while
  build? defaults to =#f=. If =#:build= is =#t=, each of the results
  are built with prefix =path=. Note that this is not recursive, for
  that, use the *sequence generator =in-directory=*.

From =racket/file=:
- *=file->string=*: this READs the file content to a string
- =file->value=: READs a single S-expression using =read=. Seems that
  the file can contain more
- =file->list path [proc = read]=: reads the file content with proc
  until EOF
- =file->lines=: read into lines, without line separators
- =display-to-file v path=: =display= =v= to =path=
- =write-to-file v path=: =write= =v= to =path=
- =display-lines-to-file lst path [#:separator sep]=: as name suggests, add line seperators
- =copy-directory/files src dest=
- =delete-directory/files=
- =find-files predicate [start-path]=: start-path defaults ot
  current. Use predicate to filter what should be returned. Seems that
  this is recursive.
- *=make-directory*=*: seems to be =mkdir -p=
- *=make-parent-directory*=*: this is very convenient in making a
  necessary directory to write a file
- =make-temporary-file [template copy-from-filename directory]=:
  create it, and return path.
  - template: ="rkttmp~a"=
  - copy-from-filename
    - a path: the created one is a copy of the path
    - #f: which is also default, create an empty file
    - ='directory=: create a directory(!!!) instead
  - directory: =#f=, means use default temporary path (=/var/tmp=)

*** Networking
I'm not going to dig deep on this because I don't use it. Just listing
available functions. Needs require 

TCP (=racket/tcp=)
- =tcp-listen port-no=: return =tcp-listener?=
- =tcp-connect hostname port-no=: return =input-port?= =output-port?=
- =tcp-accept listener=: return =input-port?= =output-port?=
- =tcp-close listener=

UDP (=racket/udp=)
- =udp-open-socket=
- =udp-bind! udp-socket hostname-string port-no=
- =udp-connect! udp-socket hostname-string port-no=
- =udp-send-to udp-socket hostname port-no bstr=
- =udp-send udp-socket bstr=
- =udp-receive! udp-socket bstr=
- =udp-send-to*=, =udp-send*=, =udp-receive!*=: non-block
- udp-close udp-socket

*** Processes
- =subprocess stdout stdin stderr cmd arg ...=
  - the command runs ASYNC, it seems that it will run immediately
  - If provided a port, it will use that. Otherwise (provide =#f=), it
    will create one, and get returned. The return value is exactly the
    same: =subprocess? port? port? port? path-string? string?=. =#f=
    means no, no matter as parameter or return value.
  - stderr can be ='stdout=, in which case the corresponding return
    value will be =#f=
  - All ports returned must be closed manually
  - since the ports have capacity, it is possible to have deadlock
- =subprocess-wait=: block until subprocess terminate
- =subprocess-status=: returns either ='running= or the exit code
- =subprocess-kill=
- =subprocess-pid=

In =racket/system=:
- =system cmd=: execute cmd *through shell command*
  SYNChronously. Return #t for success, #f for fail
- =system* cmd arg ...=: differ in:
  - execute directly instead of through shell command
  - obviously arguments are provided as arguments instead of in string
- =system/exit-code cmd=: same as =system=, but the return is exit
  code
- =system*/exit-code cmd arg ...=
- =process cmd=: run ASYNC, through a shell, return (input port,
  output port, PID, stderr, proc). All ports must be closed
  manually. The procedure =proc= can accept one argument, and is used
  to interact with the process. The argument can be:
  - ='status=: return one of ='running=, ='done-ok=, ='done-error=
  - ='exit-code=
  - ='wait=: block until terminate
  - ='interrupt=: send SIGINT
  - ='kill=
- =process* cmd arg ...=: like the difference of =system*= with
  =system=
- =process/ports out in error-out cmd=: You can provide the ports (the
  return will be =#f=), or provide =#f= (the ports are created and
  returned).
- =process*/ports out in error-out cmd arg ...=

*** CMD parsing (racket/cmdline)
The =command-line= macro actually parse the command line. The
=current-command-line-arguments= is actually a parameter that returns
a vector of strings. It is the cmd args that used to run the racket
program. Thus =command-line= consumes this value. But since it is a
parameter, you can access it as many times as you want.

All the arguments are actually keyword arguments, but they must appear
in order, according to the grammar.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(command-line [name-expr] [argv-expr] flag-clause ... finish-clause)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The flag clauses can be:
- =#:multi=: flags can appear multiple times
- =#:once-each=: each flag can appear one time
- =#:once-any=: one of the flag can appear
- =#:final=: this is like =#:multi=, but no argument is treated as
  flag any more after it (means they are all left over)

Each of them will be followed by some =flag-sepcs=:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
flag-spec ::= (flags id ... help-spec body ...+)
flags ::= flag-string | (flag-string ...+)
help-spec ::= string | (string-expr ...+)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Flags are equivalent, usually to supply =-x= and =--longer-x=. If
=help-spec= is a list of strings, they are printed in separate lines.

The =flag-clause= can also be some general printing service, followed
by strings to print
- =#:usage-help=: this is going to be printed right after the /usage/
  of the command
- =#:ps=: insert at the end of the help


Finish clause just use =#:args arg-formals body ...+=. It is intended
to handle left over arguments. arg-formals can be just a single ID, in
which case it will be a list of left over arguments. It can also be a
list, which indicates how many left over are expected. The body are
executed and the value of last is returned as the result.

A typical command line parser looks like this. It typically:
- set parameters
- print messages
- return file lists

#+BEGIN_SRC racket

** Trouble shooting

*** racket cannot find browsers
Browsers are declared in sendurl.rkt, with

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (define all-unix-browsers
    '(
      firefox
      google-chrome
      galeon
      opera
      mozilla
      konqueror
      ;; ...
      ))
#+END_SRC

chromium is not in the list, thus
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(require net/sendurl)
unix-browser-list ;; empty
(send-url "google.com") ;; error
#+END_SRC

The trick is to create a soft link for chromium named "google-chrome".
Also, the default is using firefox ... So I need to make sure firefox
is uninstalled. Is there a better way to configure browser??

The =racket-doc= will use the local racket document to search, thus in
order for it to work, install =racket-doc= package.

**** Tree layout
tree-layout creates a layout containing edges. The layout can be
rendered to pict by
- naive-layered (seems to be good)
- binary-tidier
- hv-alternating

*** graph
This is a generic graphic library.  graph is defined through a generic
interface =gen:graph=, supporting the following methods:
- has-vertex?
- has-edge?
- vertex=?
- add-vertex!
- remove-vertex!
- rename-vertex!
- add-edge!
- remove-edge!
- get-vertices
- in-vertices
- get-neighbors
- in-neighbors
- get-edges
- in-edges
- edge-weight
- transpose
- graph-copy
- graph-union!

This actually is mostly not functional.

To construct a graph, use =directed-graph= or =undirected-graph= with
list of edges represented as list of vertex, with first being the
source, rest being target. These functions seems only support single
target.

The library let you define vertex and edge properties, just like those
in boost library. You can do bfs or dfs, shortest path, graph
coloring, maximum flow.

Finally, you can call =graphviz= to convert the graph to a string of
dot format. It cannot output a =pict=.


*** 2htdp/image
This is teachpack of How to design program version 2.  It provides
several basic images, rotation, scale, flip, overlay.

Other interesting packages in this pack:
- 2htdp/planetcute contains many images


**** Common Concepts
The length is measured in terms of pixels, angle means degree. When
using names, both string and symbol are acceptable, and
case-insensitive.

Mode can be ='solid= or ='outline=. The string format is also
supported. Solid fills, outline only draws the outside line. A integer
between 0 and 255 instead will indicate the transparency.

Color can be name or color structure. If the name is not recognized,
no error is reported, and black is used. The complete list (plus
=transparent=) is in the document of =color-database<%>=. This is an
interface, defined in =racket/draw=.

The color structure is
#+begin_src racket
(struct color (red green blue alpha))
#+end_src


In many places, the color also accepts a pen. =pen= is a structure. It
seems only for drawing lines, so outline mode will support it. Its
definition is

#+begin_src racket
(struct pen (color width style cap join))
#+end_src

- style :: solid, dot, long-dash, short-dash, dot-dash
- cap :: round, projecting, butt
- join :: round, bevel, miter

When doing alignment, you can use pinhole, only if all the images have
a pinhole. You can add pinhole to image by
- center-pinhole image
- put-pinhole x y image
- clear-pinhole

And retrieve pinhole by
- pinhole-x
- pinhole-y


**** basic shape
- shape
  - =(circle radius mode color)=
  - =(ellipse width height mode color)=
  - triangle
    - =(triangle side-length mode color)=
    - right-triangle
    - isosceles-triangle
    - triangle/sss
  - square x
  - rectangle x y
  - rhombus x θ
  - star
    - star x
    - star-polygon
    - radial-star
  - polygon
    - regular-polygon
    - polygon
    - add-polygon
    - scene+polygon
- line
  - =(line x y color)=: draw a line from (0,0) to (x,y).
  - =(add-line image x1 y1 x2 y2 color)=: add line to image, from
    (x1,y1) to (x2,y2)
  - =add-curve=
  - =add-solid-curve=
- text
  - =(text string font-size color)=
  - =text/font=: this will use a complete font specification,
    including
    - face: which font name
    - family: default, script, modern, etc
    - style: normal, italic
    - weight: normal, bold, light
    - underline?: #t #f


**** Overlay
- =overlay= accepts a sequence of images, with the first being on
  top. Images are aligned on their center.
- =overlay/align x-place y-place= controls where to align the images.
  - x: left, right, middle, center, pinhole
  - y: top, bottom, middle, center, baseline, pinhole
- =overlay/offset i1 x y i2=: moves i2 by (x,y) compared to (0,0),
  thus to down right
- =overlay/align/offset= combines both options
- =overlay/xy=: what's the difference from offset?
- =overlay/pinhole=

There's also an =underlay= version that does the reverse order, for
all above.

- =beside= accepts images, and placing them in horizontal row, aligned
  on their centers
- =beside/align y=
- =above=: in a vertical row
- =above/align x=


**** scene
Typically you place images on a scene. If an image is placed (using
those place functions) or add lines (using scene+XXX) on scene, it is
cropped based on the size of scene. You can still compose the image by
overlay or add-line, but those does not respect the size of scene.

- =empty-scene x y color=
- =place-image image x y scene=: the (x,y) is according to the
  top-left corner of scene
- =place-image/align image=
- =place-images=: just a list of images and a list of positions
- =place-images/align=
- =scene+line=: add a line to the scene
- =scene+curve=

**** transform
- =rotate angle image=
- =scale factor image=
- =scale/xy=: using different factor for x and y
- =flip-horizontal image=
- =flip-vertical image=
- =crop x y width height image=
- =crop/align=
- =frame image=: return an image with a black frame around the
  /bounding box/ of the it. Even if the image might be a circle, the
  bounding box is still rectangle.
- =color-frame color image=


**** bitmap
You can load a bit map file by =(bitmap filename)=, or =(bitmap/url
url)= to download from web. For a vector image you created in racket,
you can "freeze" it to bitmap by =freeze image=.

Finally, you can save image to file by
- =save-image image filename [width height]=: png
- =save-svg-image image filename [width height]=: svg

**** properties
- image-width
- image-height
- image-baseline


*** Networking
**** HTML parsing
The package is =html-parsing=. It has only one function, =html->xexp=.

The xexp is a list like this:

#+begin_example
(*TOP* (html (head (title) (title "whatever"))
  (body "\n"
    (a (@ (href "url")) "link"))))
#+end_example

The xexp needs to use =sxml= (needs install) package to
parse. =sxpath= is a function for XPath like query. Use like this
#+begin_src racket
((sxpath '(html body table tr td a @ (*or* href title)))
 table)
#+end_src

sxpath itself returns a function, apply that function on an xexp data,
a list will be returned for matched results.
1. the xexp must begin with =*TOP*=, the query result will not have
   it. So if you want to parse it again, construct it by =`(*TOP* ,x)=
2. the xpath starts from root (html)
3. you can use ='(// table)= to query tables at arbitrary level

**** URL & HTTP
require the package =net/url= (needs install) and
=net/url-string=. First, construct a url by =string->url=, then, open
input port by =get-pure-port=, this is using =GET= method. The port
can be used as input, e.g. =port->string=. How to download binary
file, like pdf? It should be bytes streaming, so maybe
- copy-port in out
- port->bytes then write-bytes


The =call/input-url URL connect handle= will call handle on the port,
and close the port on return. The connect is a procedure,
e.g. =get-pure-port=.

- paredit-join-sexps (M-J): join



** List
The function =cons= builds lists. If second argument is a list, it
adds the first one onto the list. This is called "consing onto the
list". =cons= returns a newly allocated cons. Thus allocating memory
from the heap is sometimes generally known as /consing/. =list= can
also be used to create a list.  =append= connect several list to
become one.  A /proper list/ is either =nil=, or a cons whose =cdr= is
a proper list. This definition is recursive. Improper list is shown in
/dotted notation/, and is called a /dotted list/. The predicate =null=
is specifically test /empty list/.


A family of functions is used to access elements of the list. The
=car= of a list is the first element, the =cdr= is everything after
the first. Common lisp also provides =caar=, =cdddr=, all the
combinations up to 4-level.  List has some special function to handle.
=nth= and =nthcdr= is used to access element.  =first=, =second=, ...,
=tenth= can retrieve corresponding element. =last=, =butlast=, and
=rest= are also intuitive. =nbutlast= is the destructive version of
=butlast=.





There are also some functions to access list properties.
=list-length= returns the length. =endp= is a predicate to check the
end of a list

List can be used to represent different data structures.  
1. It can simulate a stack. =push= and =pop= are macros, and are
   defined using =setf=. =pushnew= is a variant of =push= that uses
   =adjoin= instead of =cons=.
2. List can form a tree. When using =cons=, the pointers are
   constructed in the list, thus lists might share
   components. Sometimes you have to make a copy of a list to avoid
   chaning other lists. 
   - There are two functions to make copies: =copy-list= and
     =copy-tree=. =copy-list= recursive calls on the cdr of the list,
     thus it is not deep copy. On the contrary, =copy-tree= recurs on
     both =car= and =cdr=, thus copy entire list.  Similarly,
     =tree-equal= can be used to test the equality of the whole tree.
   - To modify the structure of a list, =substitute= replace elements
     in a sequence, it does not go into deeper tree. The function
     =subst= will replaces elements in tree, deeply.  Such form that
     recursing down both car and cdr is said to be /doubly recursive/.
     =subst-if= and =subst-if-not= provides the conditional
     substitution.  Their destructive versions are available for
     efficiency =nsubst=, =nsubst-if=, =nsubst-if-not=.
3. List can also simulate a set. You can add an item to a set (a list)
   by =adjoin=. It will cons the item onto the list if it is not in
   the set. You can tell the member via =member=, =member-if=,
   =member-if-not=. Set operations include =adjoin=, =union=,
   =intersection=, =set-difference=, =set-exclusive-or= and their
   destructive counterparts =nunion=, =nintersection=,
   =nset-difference=, =nset-exclusive-or=.  You can predict subset
   with =subsetp= and tail with =tailp=.
4. Finally, /Association Lists/ are maps. This is often called
   /assoc-list/ or /alist/, representing mapping. It is only used for
   small maps, because it is not efficient. The alist is just list of
   cons cells whose car is key, cdr is value. Apart from build the
   list of cons cells, =parilis= can be used to create a =alist= from
   lists of keys and values. Add new key value pairs onto the alist
   with =acons=. Use =assoc= to retrieve the first *cons cell* with
   the key, and =nil= if not found. Use =setf= with =assoc= to set the
   value.  The condition version of =assoc= are =assoc-if= and
   =assoc-if-not=.  Lisp allows not only map from car to cdr, but also
   cdr to car with =rassoc=, =rassoc-if=, =rassoc-if-not=. Use
   =copy-alist= to copy the alist.
5. The /Property list/ (plist for short) is similar to alist, but
   structured differently. It is a flat list, with keys and values
   intersect each other. E.g. =(A 1 B 2)=. It is less flexible than
   the alist, and you can only use =getf= with a key to get the
   value. =getf= and =setf= can be used together to set the value. Use
   =remf= to remove a key value pair from the plist. You can also
   retrieve multiple key-values by =get-properties=.
   - The special thing about plist is that, each symbol has a
     plist. It can be retrieved by =symbol-plist=, but this is rarely
     used because the whole plist is not often the focus. What you
     need is =get= that directly get the key of the plist of the
     symbol. In other words, =(get 'symbol 'key)= equals to =(getf
     (symbol-plist 'symbol) 'key)=. =remprop= is a similar function to
     =remf=.

Mapping is very powerful. The most frequently used is =mapcar=. It
takes a function and some lists. Each time, it takes one element from
the lists out as arguments to the function, until some list runs out,
and finally return the results in a list.  =maplist= takes the same
arguments and does the same thing, but everytime apply function on the
cdrs of the lists. Other map functions include =mapcan=, =mapcon=,
=mapc=, =mapl=.

One last trick, the =destructuring-bind= can be used to bind
variables. It cna be used to bind into tree structures.


#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(destructuring-bind (x y z) (list 1 2 3))
(destructuring-bind (x y z) (list 1 (list 2 20) 3)) ; y = (2 20)
(destructuring-bind (x (y1 y2) z) (list 1 (list 2 20) 3)) ; y1=2

# - mapc
# - mapl
# - mapcan
# - mapcon

# - revappend
# - nconc
# - nreconc
# - ldiff


# - sublis
# - nsublis



** Sequence
Sequence contains both lists and vectors. To tell what kind of
sequence it is, one can use =consp=, =listp=, =bit-vector-p=,
=vectorp=, =simple-vector-p=, =simple-bit-vector-p=, =arrayp=.
You can use =length= to get the length of a list. 

Accessing the element of a sequence with =elt=. =subseq= get the
subsequence in =[begin,end)= with index starting from 0.

In modifying a list, =reverse= and =nreverse= reverses the list.
=remove=, =remove-if=, =remove-if-not= remove from a sequence while
the destructive version named =delete= =delete-if= =delete-if-not=.
=remove-duplicates= and =delete-duplicates= make sure no same element
in the sequence.  =substitute=, =substitute-if=, =substitute-if-not=
replace within the sequence, does not go deeper.  =nsubstitute=
=nsubstitute-if= =nsubstitute-if-not= are destructive.  There are
=sort= and =stable-sort=, but they are destrictuve, so if in doubt,
pass a copy.  =concatenate= (reqiures type) is used for concatenate
many sequences into one. =merge= (requires type) destructively merge
two sequence. If both of them are sorted, the result is also sorted.

It is possible to search inside a sequence. =find= and =position=
returns the element and index of the first match, respectively.  Their
predicate versions are =find-if=, =find-if-not= and =position-if=,
=position-if-not=.  =count=, =count-if=, =count-if-not= returns the
count. One can also =search= a sequence in another.

=map= (requires return type) maps a function to a sequence. The map
also needs a type as first argument. =nil= means no return, then map
will return nil. =map-into= does not require a type, but the first
argument is a sequence that will be destructed.  Kind of a mapping,
but =every=, =notany= and =some=, =notevery= are *predicates* to test
on a sequence. =reduce= differs from =map= in that it always utilize
the previous result in the next computation.

# - copy-seq
# - length
# - make-sequence
# - fill
# - replace

** String
A string is a specialized vector (one-dimensional array) whose
elements are characters.  A character object can be notated by writing
=#\c= where c is any standard character.

To access the characters, instead of =aref=, you can use =char= which
is faster.

# - characterp
# - stringp
# - simple-string-p

In comparision, while numeric value uses ~=~, ~/=~ and ~<~, characters
have case sensitive (~char=~, ~char/=~, ~char<~) and insensitive
versions (=char-equal=, =char-not-equal=, =char-lessp=). Strings also
have case sensitive (~string=~, ~string/=~, ~string<~) and insensitive
versions (=string-equal=, =string-not-equal=, =string-lessp=). This is
actually a family of functions: =string-greaterp=,
=string-not-greaterp=, =string-not-lessp=.

You can construct a string by =make-string= with size, or convert from
another type to string via =string=. Trimming a string is handled by
=string-trim=, =string-left-trim=, =string-right-trim=.  Case
conversion can be done by =string-upcase=, =string-downcase=,
=string-capitalize= and their destructive versions =nstring-upcase=,
=nstring-downcase=, =nstring-capitalize=.


** Array
Array can be general array, holding arbitrary object types; it can
also be a specialized array that hold a given type, which increase the
efficiency.  One dimentional arrays are called vectors. Vectors
holding arbitrary objects are /general vectors/.

There are two kinds of array: fixed and resizable. An array can be
created by =make-array=. Since vector is more often used, you can
simply use =vector= to create a one-dimension array. When you make an
array, you specify the size, making a fixed size array. For resizable,
there're two ways. First, you can give a =:fill-pointer= when making
the array. For example =(make-array 5 :fill-pointer 0)= makes an
*empty* array of *capacity* 5. This array can be used in =vector-push=
and =vector-pop= who operates on the :fill-pointer. However, this
seems resizable, but the capacity is at most 5. The second way to make
the real resizable array is to give =:adjustable t= option wehn making
it. Instead of using =vector-push=, you use =vector-push-extend= to
operate on it so that it can take care of the capacity. The arrays are
all general array that can hold different data types, you can create
an array suitable for one type by giving =:element-type= option.

=aref= is used to access the element of an array. To replace
elements, we use =setf= with =aref=.  For vector, you might want to
use =svref=, where =sv= means "simple vector", to access elements
faster.

# - array-rank-limit: *constant*
# - array-dimension-limit: *constant*
# - array-total-size-limit: *constant*
# - vector

# - array-element-type
# - array-rank
# - array-dimension
# - array-dimensions
# - array-total-size
# - array-in-bounds-p
# - array-row-major-index
# - row-major-aref
# - adjustable-array-p

Array holding type =bit= are called /bit-vectors/. Bit operations are
supported via =bit=, =sbit=, =bit-and=, =bit-ior=, =bit-xor=,
=bit-eqv=, =bit-nand=, =bit-nor=, =bit-andc1=, =bit-andc2=,
=bit-orc1=, =bit-orc2=, =bit-not=

# The /fill pointer/ is a non-negative integer no larger than the total
# number of elements in the vector (array-dimension). It is the number
# of filled-in elements in the vector.
# - array-has-fill-pointer
# - fill-pointer
# - vector-push
# - vector-push-extend
# - vector-pop

# - adjust-array

** Structure
Macro =(defstruct point x y)= will also define =make-point=,
=point-p=, =copy-point=, =point-x=, =point-y=. The read format is =#S=.

** Hash Table
This is a map. =make-hash-table= creates a hash-table. The test
predicate =:test= for keys can be one of =eq= =eql= =equal= =equalp=
with =eql= as default.

=gethash= retrieve from the table. It returns multiple values, with
first be the value of the key or nil if no such key. The second value
present whether the key is present.  Use =setf= together with
=gethash= can set the hash.

To remove an object from hash table, use =remhash=. You can also clear
the table by =clrhash=.  To iterate through a hash table, use
=maphash=.

# - hash-table-p
# - clrhash
# - hash-table-count
# - with-hash-table-iterator
# - hash-table-rehash-size
# - hash-table-rehash-threshold
# - hash-table-size
# - hash-table-test
** Symbols & Variables
Lisp is case-insensitive. The program will be converted to upper case
when stored in computer.  Symbol names can be, in addition to letters
and numbers, the following characters can also be considered to be
alphabet: ~+ - * / @ $ % ^ & _ = < > ~ .~ Conventionaly we write
=+global-constant+= and =*global-variable*=.

# The following characters are also alphabet, not used by common lisp
# standard, but reserved for some purpose:
# #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# ? ! [ ] { }
# #+END_EXAMPLE

A symbol has a /Property List/. It can be retrieved by =symbol-plist=. 

# - get
# - remprop
# - getf
# - remf
# - get-properties

Global variable can be defined by =defvar= and =defparameter=. Naming
convention is put =*= surrounds it.  The difference (Prefer =defvar=):
- =defparameter= will always assign the initial value
- =defvar= will do so only if the variable is not defined; =defvar=
  can also be used without initial value, the variable will be
  unbound.

=defconstant= is used to declare constant. Use =+= surrounds it.  It
is possible to redefine the constant using =defconstant= again, but
the behavior is undefined.  E.g. the code refer to it might need to be
reevaluated to see the update.  So, do NOT redefine a constant,
otherwise it is not a constant, use =defparameter= instead.

Local variables have lexical binding, global variables have dynamic
binding. Under lexical scope, a symbol refers to the variable where
the symbol appears. With dynamic scope, a variable is looked up where
the function is called, not where it is defined. To cause a local
variable to have dynamic scope, we =declare= it to be =special=
(=(declare (special x))=).

# Although the global variable can be referred at any place, the binding
# is still quite lexical regarding to the binding form.  E.g, the let
# binding can rebind the global variable, and everything before the
# return of let form sees this binding.  After the return, the binding
# fall back to the previous binding.  This is good because when you want
# to temporary change the =*standard-output*= to a file, you don't need
# to have to remember to change it back.

# This also means, assign to global variable only modify the specific
# binding, while the binding on the stack does not change.  Lisp did
# this by looking up the name of variable: if it is declared by =defvar=
# or =defparameter=, it will creates dynamic binding.

 Assigning a value to a binding is:
 1. change the binding only, do not change other hidden bindings for
    this symbol
 2. do not change the value object the binding refers to

The symbol is a reference of the object.  Assigning to the symbol will
create another reference to another object.  But, if the object is
mutable, then assign to the reference will change the object.
Function parameters are reference.  So if the object is mutable, then
assigning to the parameter will change the referenced object.


 # #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
 # (defparameter *varname* init-value "Optional document string")
 # (defvar *varname* optional-init-value "optional document string")
 # (defconstant +name+ init-value "optional document string")
 # #+END_SRC

 The general assignment operator is =setf (place value)+=.  When
 assigning a binding, it will call =setq= (but don't call =setq=
 directly!), and returns the newly assigned value.  In the document, a
 /SEFTable/ thing is suitable to be a =setf= /place/.  Always use
 =setf= instead of =setq=.  This is more general. This includes
 /variables, array locations, list elements, hash table entries,
 structure fields, and object slots/.

 To make the code more concise, some "f-family" are invented.
 - =(incf x)= :: =(setf x (+ x 1))=
 - =(decf x)= ::
 - =(incf x 10)= ::

 here =incf= and =decf= modifies the argument, so they are called
 /modify macros/.  Other /modify macros/:
 - =push=, =pop=, =pushnew=
 - =rotatef=, =shiftf=
   - =(roratef a b)= is equal to =(let ((tmp a)) (setf a b b tmp) nil)=
   - =(shiftf a b 10)= shifts all the values left, equals to =(let ((tmp a)) (setf a b b 10) tmp)=

 There are two types of destructive functions:
 - /for-side-effect/: typically use =setf=
 - /recycling operation/

 The recycling operations are typically those with =n= as prefix.  80
 percent of the use cases are =PUSH/NREVERSE= and =SETF/DELETE=.

 #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
 (defun upto (max)
   (let ((result nil))
     (dotimes (i max)
       (push i result))
     (nreverse result)))
 #+END_SRC

 #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
 (setf foo (delete nil foo))
 #+END_SRC

 =sort= is also destructive, so use it on a copy of the list. Be sure
 to assign it back to the variable.

 #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
 (defparameter *list* (list 4 3 2 1))
 (sort *list* #'<) ;; (1 2 3 4)
 *list* ;; (4)
 ;; so shoud use:
 (setf *list* (sort *list* #'<))
 #+END_SRC

*** Equality
The reason Lisp has no pointer is that every value is conceptually a
pointer. For efficiency, Lisp will sometime choose to use some
intermediate representation instead of a pointer. E.g. a small integer
takes no more space than a pointer, Lisp implementation might just use
that. This will introduce difference when testing equility.

 - =EQ= tests for object identity. Two objects are =EQ= if they're
   identical (same object).  It CANNOT compare numbers and characters,
   which gives undefined behavior.
 - =EQL= is similar to =EQ= except that it guarantees the same numeric
   or character value is equal. =(eql 1 1)= is =t=.
 - =EQ= is more efficient than =EQL= because it does not need to check
   whether it is numeric or character.  But =EQL= has less trouble to
   understand .. so use =EQL= when possible.
 - =EQUAL= is looser than =EQL=. It consider objects to be the same as
   long as they prints the same.
 - =EQUALP= is even looser. For example, it consider two strings are
   equal case-insensitively. NEVER use this.

** Type
Common Lisp is strong typed, but the type is associated with objects,
not variables. This approach is called /manifest typing/. Though type
declarations are completely optional, you might want to do this for
efficiency.

=nil= is false, everything else is true =nil= is both an atom and a
list. =()= is exactly the same as =nil=

In Common Lisp, the types form a hierarchy. An object always has more
than one type. The type =t= is the super type of all types, so
everything is of type =t=. For example, a number 13 is of type
=fixnum=, =integer=, =rational=, =real=, =number=, =atom=, =t=.

Function =typep= (=(typep obj type)=) tests whether an object is of a type.
=(subtypep type1 type2)= tests the type hierarchy.

Type conversion functions are those I found used most but hardly
remember, documenting here.
- =parse-integer=: string to integer

** Numbers
Numbers can use read form, e.g. =#b010101=, =#xaf08=. Predicates such
as =numberp=, =integerp=, =rationalp=, =floatp=, =realp=, =complexp=
can test the type of an object. For numbers, =zerop=, =plusp=,
=minusp=, =oddp=, =evenp= can tests the property.

Number comparison can be ~<~, ~>~, ~<=~, ~>=~, ~=~.  These are same as
using the operator sequencially on the operands. ~/=~ works
pairwise. =max= and =min= get the maximum and minimum one.

=(1+ x)= same as =(+ x 1)=.  =incf= and =decf= are destructive.  =gcd=
greatest common divisor, =lcm= least common multiple.

Scientific computations are supported. =exp= computes exponential with
$e$ while =expt= computes general exponential. =log= computes log to
$e$ if the second parameter is omitted. =sqrt= is a special case of
=expt= with =1/2= as the power.  

The function of type name is used to do convertion, including =float=,
=rational=. Some types of number have two parts. For ratio,
=numerator= and =denominator= get the two parts. Break number into two
parts can be done by several pairs of functions: =signum= and =abs=
(sign and value), =mod= and =rem=, =realpart= and =imagpart= for
=complex=.

Rounding can be done with =floor= (toward negative infinity),
=ceiling= (toward positive infinity), =truncate= (toward 0), and
=round= (to nearest integer).  Float version is also available:
=ffloor=, =fceiling=, =ftruncate=, =fround=.

Logical operations are available as well.  =logior=, =logxor=,
=logand=, =logeqv=, =lognand=, =lognor=, =logandc1=, =logandc2=,
=logorc1=, =logorc2=, =lognot= Besides, =boole= seems to be a more
general function that accept many operations that cover all above.

=random= create random numbers.
# *** Byte
# - byte
# - byte-size
# - byte-position
# - ldb
# - ldb-test
# - mask-field
# - dpb
# - deposit-field

# *** Random Numbers
# - =*random-state*=
# - make-random-state
# - random-state-p


** Function
The predicate =fboundp= tells whether there's a function with a given
symbol name. =symbol-function= can retrieve the function object with
the symbol. The document of a globally defined function can be
retrieved by calling =documentation=. The function's read format is
called /sharp-quote/, the special form =function= takes a function
name and return the function object.  The function object can be
obtained by =#'=.

*** Defun and Lambda Expression
=defun= is a macro.
 #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (defun name (a b
                  &optional op1
                    (op2 def-value)
                    (op3 def-value op3-supplied-p)
                  &rest rests
                  &key k1
                    (k2 def-value k2-supplied-p)
                    ((:kkkkk3 k3) def-value k3-supplied-p))
       (body-forms))
 #+END_SRC

lambda expression shares the same structures.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (lambda
      (a b &optional op1 &rest rests &key k1)
    (body))
#+END_SRC

When calling a function, order of consumption matters. First required
arguments are consumed, then the optional arguments, then the rest,
finally the keyword arguments. Optional arguments can have default
values (which defaults to nil), and a variable to indicate whether it
is supplied. Keyword arguments are the same as optional arguments,
except it must be supplied by keyword. It can be rebound to a simpler
name to be used in the body. Finally, never mix (optional, key).  You
can mix rest and key, but the behavior is, after matching all required
and optional, everything are bound to rest.  Then appropriate ones are
ALSO bound to keyword arguments.

The return value of function is typically the last expression.  But
you can explicit return from a function by using =RETURN-FROM SYMBOL
body= special form.  Symbol is the function name to return, and it is
not evaluted.  You must provide the function in order to return, which
makes it not frequently used.  If return multiple values, use =values=
instead of a list; if return no values, use
=(values)=. =multiple-value-bind= can be used to decouple the
values. You can pass on multiple values as arguments to a second
function using =multiple-value-call=.

One can apply the object in two ways: =funcall= and =apply=. They
differ in that =funcall= accepts the arguments, while in =apply= the
arguments must be a list. The list can be looser, e.g. some arguments,
as long as the last one is a list.

In eailier lisp, functions were represented internally as lists. The
only way to tell a function from an ordinary list was to check if the
first element was the symbol =lambda=. Common lisp represent function
differently, so =lambda= is no longer necessary.

# - values-list
# - multiple-value-list
# - multiple-value-prog1
# - multiple-value-setq
# - nth-value

** Macro
Macro is designed to abstract away common syntactic patterns.

=macroexpand-1= can be used to check the expension in one level.

When designing macros, there are three kinds of leaks of
implementation details that you need avoid.
- multiple evaluation of parameters
  - You must evaluate each param once, because that is the intuition
    of user of the macro.
  - to fix it, evaluate it ones and bind to a variable
- order of evaluating parameters
  - you need to make sure the order of evaluation of parameters is
    from left to right. Again this to follow the intuition of user.
- variable scope
  - use GENSYM to create name to use. For example the code below, the
    name is generated at expanding time, and =,name= is used whenever
    you want to use the variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defmacro mymac (param)
    (let ((name (gensym)))
      `(let ((,name ,param))
         ,name)))
#+END_SRC


** Evaluation
- eval form: evaluate form in the current dynamic environment and a
  null lexical environment
- evalhook
- applyhook

The =quote= operator is a /special operator/, meaning that it has a
distinct evaluation rule of its own: do nothing. =(quote (+ 3 5))= is
same as ='(+ 3 5)=. It is a way of pretecting expressions from
evaluation.

Integers and strings both evaluate to themselves. =nil= evaluates to
itself as well. Empty list () is exactly =nil=, thus is also
self-evaluated.

There are 25 special operators
- block
- catch
- compiler-let
- declare
- eval-when
- flet
- function
- go
- if
- labels
- let
- let*
- macrolet
- multiple-value-call
- multiple-value-prog1
- progn
- progv
- quote
- return-from
- setq
- tagbody
- the
- throw
- unwind-protect

When compile a file, it evaluates all top level forms in the file. If
the top level is =eval-when=, things can be controled. =eval-when=
accepts three different situations, namely =:compile-toplevel=,
=:load-toplevel=, =:execute=. You can specify multiple of them, thus
can make the top level evaluates at compile time, load time, or both.

There's probably only one eval-when is useful, that is use ALL of
them:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(EVAL-WHEN
 (:COMPILE-TOPLEVEL :LOAD-TOPLEVEL :EXECUTE)
 ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

should wrap things that need be available in the compilation
environment as well as the target environment. E.g. a defined function
that is used in defmacro.

** Exception

A =catch= expression takes a tag, which can be any kind of object,
followed by a body of expressions. A =throw= with the corresponding
tag will cause =catch= to return immediately.  If there's no pending
catch with the right tag, the =throw= causes an error.

Calling =error= interrupt the execution, and transfer the control to
the lisp error handler.

=cond= corresponds to switch statement in C. The test predicates are
evaluated one by one until one to =t=, then evaluate the body form,
and return the last.  To have a default, put a =t= as the last
condition.

Lisp programmers often use the functions and and or to implement
simple conditional evaluation. For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; use
  (and x (setf y t))
  ;; instead of
  (when x
    (setf y t))
  ;; use
  (or x (setf y t))

=dotimes= from 0 to the value of count-form-1, inclusively In =do=,
the var-def is =(var init-form step-form)=. For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(do ((i 0 (1+ i))) ((> i 4)) (print i))
#+END_SRC


**** Append to a list
Remember that append copies its arguments.  Avoid using append
inside a loop to add elements to the back of a list.  Use the
collect clause in loop, or push elements onto a list and then
nreverse the list to return the original ordering.

Bad:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(let ((result ()))
  (dolist (x list)
    (setf result (append result (list x))))
  result)
#+END_SRC
Better:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(let ((result ()))
  (dolist (x list)
    (push x result))
  (nreverse result))
#+END_SRC
Best:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (loop for x in list collect x)
#+END_SRC

** Loop Facility
/Loop keywords/ are not true common lisp keywords. They are symbols
recognized only by /Loop Facility/. If you do not use any loop
keywords, the loop simply runs forever.

loop is a macro, and expansion produces an implicit block named =nil=,
and it accepts three basic part in its tagbody:
- loop prologue: execute before iteration begin
- loop body: execute during each iteration
- loop epilogue: execute after iteration termination

All variables are initialized in the loop prologue.

*** Loop Clauses
Inside the loop is the loop clauses.

Variable initialization and stepping
- for
- as
- with
- repeat

Value accumulation
- collect
- append
- nconc
- sum
- count
- minimize
- maximize

Termination conditions
- loop-finish
- for
- as
- repeat
- while
- until
- always
- never
- thereis

Unconditional execution
- do
- return

Conditional execution
- if
- when
- unless
- else
- end

Miscellaneous
- named
- initially
- finally
*** Loop Syntax
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
loop ::= (loop [named name] {variables}* {main}*)
variables ::= with | initial-final | for-as | repeat
main ::= unconditional | accumulation | conditional | termination | initial-final
initial-final ::= initially | finally
#+END_EXAMPLE

- A loop must have at least one clause.
- loop prologue
  - automatic variable initializations prescribed by variable clauses
  - initially
- loop epilogue
  - finally
  - implicit return value from accumulation clause or an end-test clause

*** Iteration Control (for, as, repeat)
for and as are exctly the same.

Multiple these control can be used. They will occur sequentially: they
will not nest.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
for var
  [{from | downfrom | upfrom} expr1]
  [{to | downto | upto | below | above} expr2]
  [by expr3]
#+END_EXAMPLE
- from: default to 0 when increment
- by: the step, must be positive integer, default to 1
- +downfrom, upfrom+, downto, upto: control the direction of increment
  or decrease.
- below, above: similar to upto, downto, but do not include the
  target.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
for var in expr1 [by step-fun]
#+END_EXAMPLE
- it is meant to iterate the list. Bound to element in each iteration
- At the end of each iteration, the step-fun is executed on the list
  to produce a successor list. default to =cdr=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
for var on expr1 [by step-fun]
#+END_EXAMPLE
- same as in-by, but var is bound to the entire list each time

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
for var = expr1 [then expr2]
#+END_EXAMPLE
- var is set to expr1 on first iteration
- var is set to expr2 on second and subsequent iterations.
  If no expr2, expr1 is still used.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
for var across vector
#+END_EXAMPLE
- bind to each element. The only difference is now using vector
  instead of a list.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
for var being
  {each | the}
  {hash-key | hash-keys | hash-value | hash-values}
  {in | of}
  hash-table
  [using ({hash-value | hash-key} other-var)]
#+END_EXAMPLE
- it seems that each and the is the same. Just to make it easy to read:
  - use each for hash-key and hash-value
  - use the for hash-keys and hash-values
- in and of are also the same
- hash-key and hash-value controls whether to bind key or value to var
- using will bind the other part, i.e. value if hash-key and key if
  hash-value, to another variable for access

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
for var being
  {each | the}
  {symbol | present-symbol | external-symbol | symbols | present-symbols | external-symbols}
  {in | of}
  package
#+END_EXAMPLE

In package.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
repeat expr
#+END_EXAMPLE

repeat the body (expr) times.

*** End Test Control (always, never, thereis, until, while)
always, never, thereis change the return value, so
- it will skip finally clauses.
- NEVER use it with collect, etc.

The clauses:
- while expr
- until expr: equal to while (not expr)
- always expr: terminate if expr evaluates to nil. Return nil if
  so. Otherwise return t.
- never expr: terminate if expr ever evalutes to non-nil. Return nil
  if so, otherwise return t
- thereis expr: Same as never, but it return that expr.
- loop-finish: terminate iteration and return any accumulated result

*** Value Accumulation
- multiple accumulation can be used if they operate the same type,
  e.g. collect and append operate on list. The result will be
  combined, i.e. they operate on the same list.
- If into is not provided, all the operations operate on a default
  hidden variable.
- If into is provided, the variable is as-if initialized in =with=
  clause.
  - will not have a default value to return
  - the variables are visible in finally clause
- Only one value can be returned, but you can return multiple objects
  using =values=.

Clauses: all of them have =xxx expr [into var]= format
- collect expr [into var]
- collecting expr [into var]: same as collect
- append
- appending
- nconc
- nconcing
- count
- counting
- sum
- summing
- maximize
- maximizing
- minimize
- minimizing
*** Variable Initialization (with)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
with var [= expr] {and var [= expr]}*
#+END_EXAMPLE
- if no =expr, it is initialized to appropriate default value
- by default with initialize variable sequentially
- using loop keyword =and= can make the initialization in parallel
*** Conditional Execution (if, when, unless)
They all have the same signature:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
if expr clause {and clause}*
  [else clause {and clause}*]
  [end]
#+END_EXAMPLE

- =if= and =when= are exactly the same. =unless= is equal to =if (not expr)=.
- in the case of nest, the else is paired with the closest preceding
  =when= or =if= that has no associated =else=
- loop keyword =it= can be used to refer to the value of the test
  expr. This is a keyword, thus cannot be used as a variable name in
  loop.
- =end= marks the end of the clause. If not specified, the next loop
  keyword marks the end. This is useful in compound clauses.

*** Unconditional Execution (do, return)
- do {expr}*: execute sequentially
- doing {expr}*
- return expr: equivalent to =do {return expr}=
*** Misc (named, initially, finally)
- named: name a loop so that we can use return-from
- initially, finally: expressions to be evaluated before and after
  loop body. There can be multiple these clauses, all of them will be
  collected into one place inside =progn= in the order they present.
- =return=, =always=, =never=, =thereis= can bypass finally
*** Destructure
bind result to a list of variables. This can be used in =for= and
=with=.
- If variable list is shorter, the rest values are discarded
- If value list is shorter, the rest variables initialize to default
  value






** Input/Output
These input/output operations perform on streams.  Streams are lisp
objects representing sources and destinations of characters. 

By default, input is read from the stream =*standard-input*=, output
is written to =*standard-output*=.  Conventionally the suffix =-input=
and =-output= means the input and output stream respectively, while
=-io= represents streams with bidirectional stream.  Similar variables
include =*error-output*=, =*query-io*=, =*debug-io*=, =*terminal-io*=,
=*trace-output*=.

=read= is a complete lisp parser. When inputing a number, it parses
and returns the number, instead of a string. =read= reads up to an
expression. =read-line= read until a newline. =read-from-string= read
an expression from a string. All of these are defined on the primitive
=read-char= which reads a single character. =peek-char= read the
character without removing it from the stream. You can also unread a
char by =unread-char=. =parse-integer= is often used if you want to
get the integer.

=prin1= generates output for programs (with double quotes), while
=princ= generates for human. =terpri= prints a newline.  =pprint=
prints with indention. =format= output the control-string except that
a tilde introduces a /directive/. Most directives use one or more
elements of arguments. If no more arguments, signal an error. But it
is ok is more arguments are provided and unprocessed.  If the
destination is nil, a string is created as the output and get
returned. Otherwise format returns nil.

A format directive is determined by one single character. It can take
optional prefix. The prefix can be separated using : or @ or
both. Parameters are separated by comma, and they can be ommited to
take the default value. What kind of parameters are accepted is
determined by the directive character.  The most commonly used
directive is =~A= which is a place holder for a value printed by
=princ=. =~%= outputs a newline. =~F= outputs a float number.
# #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# ~[[first-param]{,[second-param]}*]
#  [:@]
#  <char>
# #+END_EXAMPLE

# Here are the list of all directive characters
# - A: Ascii. This is the most commonly used place holder.
# - S: S-expression
# - D: Decimal
# - B: Binary
# - O: octal
# - X: hexadecimal
# - R: Radix
# - P: Plural
# - C: Character
# - F: fixed format floating point
# - E: Exponential floating point
# - G: general floating point
# - $: dollars floating point
# - %: #\Newline
# - &: refresh line. unless at the beginning of a line,output a line.
# - |: page separator
# - ~: output a tilde
# - <newline>: ignore the newline and any following whitespace
# - T: tabulate
# - *: ignore next argument
# - ?: indirection
# - _: conditional newline
# - W: wite
# - I: indent

# There are several more complicated ones not recorded here, I believe
# I'll not easily use them.


A pathname is a portable way to specifying a file. A pathname has 6
components: host, device, directory, name, type, and version.

Open a file as stream by =open=. It has some keyword arguments to
modify its behavior. =:direction= keywords takes =:input=, =:output=
or =:io=. =:if-exists= takes =:supersede=. We typically use =setf= to
store the stream returned by =open=. The steam is closed by =close=.
=with-open-file= is often more convenient, we don't need to remember
to close.

In case you only have a string, it is convenient to use
=with-input-from-string= and =with-output-to-string=.

** ASDF (Another System Definition Facility)
https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.html
*** Load ASDF
ASDF should come along with lisp implementations.

- =(require "asdf")=
- =(asdf:asdf-version)= to check whether it is loaded, what's the version

Alternatively, you can load the specific file by =(load "/path/to/asdf.lisp")=

The default load path is 
- =~/common-lisp/=
- =~/.local/share/common-lisp/source/=

However, quicklisp should already configured the load path.

*** Load System
- =(require "asdf")=
- put package somewhere so that ASDF can find it
  - =~/common-lisp/=
  - =~/.local/share/common-lisp/source/=
- load by =(asdf:load-system "my-system")=

Some functions:
- load-system
- compile-system
- test-system
- make
- require-system

*** Build System
- =(require "asdf")=
- put your code into a new directory called =my-system/= inside the findable path:
  - =~/common-lisp/=
  - =~/.local/share/common-lisp/source/=
- In the directory, create a new file =my-system.asd= and specify dependencies
- load by =(asdf:load-system "my-system")=

The system is specified using =defsystem= syntax. An example
(hello-lisp.asd):
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; Usual Lisp comments are allowed here
  (defsystem "hello-lisp"
      :description "hello-lisp: a sample Lisp system."
      :version "0.0.1"

   (defun make-comparison-expr (field value)

     ;; ` will do the same thing, and it can do one more: can evaluate part of it
     ;; , before a subexpression will evalute that
     `(equal (getf cd ,field) ,value))

   (defun make-comparisons-list (fields)
     (loop while fields
        ;; using loop facility, make comparison expr for all the fields
        ;; pop will pop the first of the list
        collecting (make-comparison-expr (pop fields) (pop fields))))

   ;; wrap comparison expr into and clause
   (defmacro where (&rest clauses)
     ;; ,@() will evaluate the subexpression, and splice the resulting list into the surrounding list
     `#'(lambda (cd) (and ,@(make-comparisons-list clauses))))

   ;; this can check what this macro expanded to
   (macroexpand-1 '(where :title "Give Us a Break" :ripped t))

   ;; Final test:
   (select (where :title "Give Us a Break" :ripped t))
